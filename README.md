## The Transformer
#### -- Project Status: Active

In this project, I aim at implementing the Transformer model from the "Attention Is All You Need" paper.

### [The Transformer model](https://github.com/rbiswasfc/Machine-Translation/blob/master/the-transformer/TheTransformer.ipynb)
A brief description:

#### Remarks
* It can utilize full GPU acceleration



## To-do list
* Train the transformer
* Investigate different initialization
* Plot attention and demonstrate alignment during translation
* Use the model architecture for other open-source machine translation datasets
